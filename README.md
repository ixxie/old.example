# Resume - Matan Bendix Shenhav

This codebase is for my professional personal site - www.shenhav.fyi.

## About

I decided to setup my resumé as a web application, since I am applying for jobs as a frontend-orientated web developer.

### goals

With this project, I *do aim to:*
 1. Create a web-based resume summerizing my skills and experience;
 2. Demonstrate my web development skills, in particular frontend skills;
 3. Get first experience with Typescript and the TailwindCSS Typography plugin;
 4. Push my agility skills to the next level;

### antigoals

With this project, I *don't aim to:*
 1. Make a reusable personal resume template;
 2. Overengineer, overplan or overdesign the application;
 3. Bore myself to death nitpicking on irrelevant details;

## Developing

Once you've clone the repository and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
